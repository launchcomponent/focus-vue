# Heading

Headings are used as titles of each major section of a page in the interface. For example, Card components generally use
headings as their title.

## Best practices

Headings should:

- Clearly describe the section of the interface they refer to
- Highlight the most important concept or piece of information users need to know
- Sit at the top of the section of interface they're referring to

## Accessibility

a clear and consistent heading structure helps users who have difficulty with reading or language. It also helps screen
reader users to navigate the page using keystrokes that are custom to their screen reader.

Use the `element` prop to determine the specific HTML element that's output for the heading. The component defaults to a
level 2 heading (`<h2>`). Use a different value for the `element` prop if a different heading fits the context beter.
