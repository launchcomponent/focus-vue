# Popover

Popovers are small overlays that open on demand. They let users access additional content and actions without cluttering the page.

## Best practices

Popovers should:

- Always be positioned next to the button or other interface elements that trigger them
- Be used for secondary or less important information and actions since they're hidden until users hit the trigger
- Contain navigation or actions that share a relationship to each other
- Be triggered by a clearly labeled button
