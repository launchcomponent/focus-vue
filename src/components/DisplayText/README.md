# Display Text

Display styles make a bold visual statement. Use them to create impact when the main goal is visual storytelling. For
example, use display text to convince or reassure users such as in marketing content or to capture attention during
onboarding.

## Best practices

- Use when the primary goal of the page is communication rather than interaction.
- Use larger display text sizes when a page is focused around a single message. In these cases it may be paired with an
  illustration.
- Use smaller display trext to pair with larger text, or alone as part of more complex data displays such as dashboards.

## Content guidelines

### Display text

Display text should be:

- Benefits-driven and focused on information that is most important to users.
- Concise and scannable:
  - Use simple, clear language that can be read at a glance
  - Keep display text content to a short sentence that's just a few words in length
  - Avoid using punctuations such as periods, commas, or semicolons
  - Avoid extra exclamation marks-display text already makes enough of a statement without an exclamation mark
  - Write in sentence
