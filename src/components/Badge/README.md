# Badge

Badges are used to inform users of the status of an object or of an action that's been taken.

## Best practices

Badges benefit users by:

- Using established color patterns so that users can quickly identify their status or importance level
- Being clearly labeled with short, scannable text
- Being positioned to clearly identify the object they're informing or labelling

## Content guidelines

### Badge label

Badge labels should:

- Use a single word to describe the status of an object
- Only use two words if you need to describe a complex state
- Always describe the status in the past tense
