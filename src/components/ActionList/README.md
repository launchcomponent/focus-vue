# Action list

Action lists render a list of actions or selectable options. This component is usually placed inside a popover container to create a
dropdown menu or let users select from a list of options.

## Best practices

Action lists should:

- Be used for secondary or less important information and actions since they're hidden until users expose them by opening a popover
- Container actions that are related to each other

## Content guidelines

### Action lists

Each item in an action list should be clear and predictable. Users should be able to anticipate what will happen when they click on an
action item.

---

## Accessibility

Items in an action list are organized as list items (`<li>`) in an unordered list (`<ul>`) and are conveyed as a group of related elements
to assistive technology users. Each item is implemented as a button.
